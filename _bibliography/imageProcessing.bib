abstract = {Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a rapidly developing non-invasive three dimensional imaging approach, and it has been widely used in examination and diagnosis of eye diseases. However, speckle noise are often inherited from image acquisition process, and may obscure the anatomical structure, such as the retinal layers. In this paper, we propose a novel method to reduce the speckle noise in 3D OCT scans, by introducing a new super-resolution approach. It uses a multi-frame fusion mechanism that merges multiple scans for the same scene, and utilizes the movements of sub-pixels to recover missing signals in one pixel, which significantly improves the image quality. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed speckle noise reduction method, we have applied it for the application of retinal layer segmentation. Results show that the proposed method has produced promising enhancement performance, and enable deep learning-based methods to obtain more accurate retinal layer segmentation results.}

abstract = {Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an imaging tool that has been widely utilized for various disease diagnoses for its noninvasive and high-resolution properties. Due to the dual role of speckles in the imaging process, however, OCT images suffer from the unavoidable speckle noise, which is usually regarded to be multiplicative in nature and reduces image contrast and resolution. In this study, we propose to categorize OCT speckle noise into additive portion and multiplicative portion, and present a simple two-step iteration (TSI) mechanism to suppress such noises separately. With the augmented Lagrange minimization (ALM) method adopted to recover a low-rank image, the first step of TSI is to remove the additive Gaussian noise, while the second step of TSI is to suppress the multiplicative noise by employing a split Bregman method (SBM) to solve the total-variation (TV) de-noising problem. Extensive experiments with OCT images of the swine eye, human and rabbit retina are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Results show that the proposed TSI method outperforms the existing methods in different cases. Specifically, TSI helps improve the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structure similarity (SSIM) of the swine eye images from 17.19 dB to 33 dB and 0.12 to 0.92, respectively, with the important structural details well preserved. The clearer boundaries and higher image contrast obtained with the TSI method would largely facilitate image analyses and interpretations for the clinical applications of OCT systems.}
