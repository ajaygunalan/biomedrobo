#### About This Site
This website aims to help biomedical engineers prepare for the Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE). The goal of this site is not to repeat what others have done. Instead, select the content that provides the best explanation for the topic and link it coherently. This way, this website will serve as a doorway to great content such as videos, books, blogs, etc., for biomedical engineers. Thus, it is a Knowledge Management System for biomedical engineers. Therefore, use it as a starting point for accessing and remembering great content.

If you are not preparing for the GATE exam, this site will still be useful as a content aggregator. In the future, we plan to bring in articles that touch the particles aspect of biomedical engineering, about various medical devices companies, and job prospects in the medical device industries. So, we believe it will be helpful for you.

#### How to use this website
You can travel to a particular topic by clicking on a topic in the latest [[syllabus]]. If you wish to be a part of this initiative and want to provide your articles for this site. Then, kindly mail us at [admin@gatebiomed.com](mailto:admin@gatebiomed.com). Note: if there is no link, no article is yet created for that topic.

#### Monetary Policy:
We do not believe in an advertisement, and we want to provide great quality content out of passion and love for the things which we build as engineers. However, If you want to encourage us for our work and contribute to our expenses, you can make a small donations. A small part of this fund goes to climate change actions. You can donate by either [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/gateBiomed) or [UPI](https://upayi.ml/ajay.gunalan@axisbank). The money received will be spent on making high-quality content for the users and for site maintenance.
