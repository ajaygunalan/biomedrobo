### Welcome! ðŸŒ±

#### About This Site
This website aims to help biomedical engineers as a content aggregator. In the future, we plan to bring in articles that touch the particles aspect of medical devices, about various medical devices companies, and job prospects in the medical device industries. So, keep an eye here.


#### How does it differentiate?
The goal of this site is not to repeat what others have done. Instead, select the content that provides the best explanation for the topic and link it coherently. This way, this website will serve as a doorway to great content such as videos, books, blogs, etc., for biomedical engineers. Thus, it is a Knowledge Management System for biomedical engineers. Therefore, use it as a starting point for accessing and remembering great content.

#### How to use this website?
You can travel to a particular topic by clicking on it. You can find all the topics on the [[content]] page. Kindly note that the link will appear if something has been published on that topic. Suppose you like what we do and want to be a part of this initiative. Then, kindly mail us at [admin@biomedrobo.com](mailto:admin@biomedrobo.com). 

#### Monetary Policy
We do not believe in an advertisement. We just want to provide great quality content out of passion and love for the things which we build as engineers. If you want to support us for our work, contribute to our growth, and be a part of the community. Then, you are welcome to make donations. A small part of this fund goes to climate change actions. You can donate to us by either by [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com//biomedRobo) or [UPI](/upi). The money received will be spent on making high-quality content and site maintenance.

#### Copyrights Policy
Kindly avoid using any images and videos from the internet to avoid copyright infringement. Just link them to the source website. However, if you still want to use it on this site. Then, kindly get proper permission to use them. If you use books, conference articles, and journal papers, kindly cite them using BibTeX.

#### Plans for the site
1. We are working on articles in the category of [sensors and bioinstrumentation](/syllabus#sensors-and-bioinstrumentation){: .internal-link}.
2. Make sure the user finds it more accessible and simpler to use the site.
3. To form a team of volunteers to run this site.
