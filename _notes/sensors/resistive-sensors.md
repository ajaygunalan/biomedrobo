A resistive sensor changes its resistance due to changes in physical quantity such as mechanical, thermal, magnetic, optical, and chemical. Now, let us look into different types of resistive sensors.

### Potentiometers (Variable Resistors)

##### Potential Issues from {% cite Pallas-Areny2001Sensors %} 
1.  Resistance fluctuation due to temperature.
2.  A potentiometer is a [[zero-order system]].
3.  The resistance is not perfectly uniform, limiting the potentiometer's linearity. The agreement between the actual and the theoretical transfer characteristic (here, a straight line) is termed [[conformity]](here linearity).
4.  For high values of resistance, parasitic capacitance may be important .

### Force Sensitive Resistor

FSR is similar to a potentiometer, but here, the wiper is the point of application of force and amount of force.

### Magnetoresistors

The resistivity of ferromagnetic materials depends on the angle between the direction of electric current and the orientation of magnetization this is known as anisotropic magnetoresistive (AMR) effect {% cite Jogschies2015Recent %}.
