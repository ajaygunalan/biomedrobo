The goal of this site is not to repeat what others have done it instead, to select the content that provides the best explanation for the topic and link it. This way, this website will serve as a doorway to great content such as videos, books, blogs, etc., for biomedical engineers. Thus, it is a Knowledge Management System for biomedical engineers. Therefore, use it as a starting point for accessing and remembering great content.
