#### 6.1.1. Resistive Sensor

A resistive sensor changes its resistance due to changes in physical quantity such as mechanical, thermal, magnetic, optical, and chemical. Now, let us look into different types of resistive sensors.

##### Potentiometers (Variable Resistors)

###### Potential Issues 
1.  Resistance fluctuation due to temperature .
2.  A potentiometer is a [[zero-order system]].
3.  The resistance is not perfectly uniform, limiting the potentiometer's linearity. The agreement between the actual and the theoretical transfer characteristic (here, a straight line) is termed [[conformity]](here linearity).
4.  For high values of resistance, parasitic capacitance may be important {% cite signaltrain %}.

##### Force Sensitive Resistor

FSR is similar to a potentiometer, but here, the wiper is the point of application of force and amount of force.
